# Sheets

Read this when the doc is a spreadsheet: a list of records with columns
someone will search, filter or sort (a tracker, an inventory, a budget, a
contact list, survey results). A sheet is an ordinary tdoc HTML document. Its
tables carry `data-tdoc-sheet`, and the reader shows them as a spreadsheet
grid with tabs, search, per-column filters, multi-column sort, a frozen header
and first column. Without the viewer (an export, a feed reader) the same
markup is a readable table. You edit a sheet the way you edit any doc: change
the HTML and publish a new version.

## The markup

One `<table data-tdoc-sheet>` per tab. `data-name` is the tab's name. The
header row is the last row of `<thead>`; each `<th>` declares its column type.

```html
<div class="tdoc-table-scroll">
<table data-tdoc-sheet data-name="Tasks">
  <thead><tr>
    <th data-type="text">Task</th>
    <th data-type="number">Points</th>
    <th data-type="date">Due</th>
    <th data-type="tags" data-palette="blocked:red, done:green">Status</th>
    <th data-type="checkbox">Shipped</th>
    <th data-type="url">Link</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr data-row="r1"><td>Billing export</td><td>5</td><td>2026-03-01</td><td><span data-tag>blocked</span> <span data-tag>q1</span></td><td>✓</td><td><a href="https://example.com/1">example.com/1</a></td></tr>
    <tr data-row="r2"><td>Search</td><td>3</td><td>2026-03-14</td><td><span data-tag>done</span></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>
```

| `data-type` | Write the cell as | Filter |
|---|---|---|
| `text` (default) | plain text | by value |
| `number` | `1200`, `1,200.50`, `$12`, `-3` | by range |
| `date` | ISO: `2026-03-01` (or `2026-03-01 14:30`) | by range |
| `tags` | `<span data-tag>a</span> <span data-tag>b</span>` | by tag (any of) |
| `checkbox` | `✓` for checked, empty for not | checked / not |
| `url` | `<a href="https://…">label</a>` | by value |

## Rows, tags, tabs

- **Row ids.** Give every body row a `data-row` id (`r1`, `r2`, …) and keep it
  when you edit: comments on a cell anchor to its row id and column, so they
  survive sorting, filtering and rows added elsewhere. A new row takes the
  next unused number. Never renumber.
- **Tag colours.** `data-palette` on the `<th>` names a colour per tag:
  `gray`, `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `teal`, `blue`, `purple`, `pink`.
  A tag the palette does not name gets a stable colour of its own.
- **Tabs.** Several sheet tables in one doc are tabs of one grid, shown where
  the first table is. Give each a distinct `data-name`. With more than one,
  add `<caption>Name</caption>` so the plain page still names each table.
- Plain text in cells: no nested tables, no `rowspan`/`colspan`, no markup
  except `<a>` in a `url` column and `<span data-tag>` in a `tags` column.
- Write prose around the sheet as usual: a heading, a line on what the sheet
  is and where it came from. Filters, sort and search are the reader's view
  and are never written into the doc.

## Size

A doc is at most 2 MB of HTML, about 5,000-8,000 rows of 20 short columns.
The grid stays smooth at 10,000 rows. Beyond that, split the data into
several docs or summarise it.

## From a file

`tdoc-new --slug <slug> --from-csv data.csv` (or `--from-tsv`, `--from-xlsx`,
one tab per worksheet) writes this markup with column types inferred. To
change a published sheet, edit its HTML: add `<tr>` rows with new ids, change
a `<td>`, or change a `<th data-type>` and rewrite that column's cells.
